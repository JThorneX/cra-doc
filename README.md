### Description

The doctor's office I use has one of the worst website's I've seen in the last decade or so. No responsiveness, design from the 90's, and most of the links are 404s. I decided to try to design my own that looks a bit more modern and is responsive. While coming up with the design, I had elderly people in mind as the boomer population grows older and needs to navigate online spaces. It is still in progress.
